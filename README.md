# WooCommerce Name Your Price Subscription switching
Enable price changing on Name Your Price subscriptions

## Notes
1. This plugin is does not receive _priority_ support.
2. Backcompatibility is not maintained, so if you are interacting with the code via snippets/filters, be careful when upgrading.
3. If switching between variation is enabled, price switching will be automatically enabled for NYP variations.
4. Enabling switching for NYP amounts therefore only applies to simple subscriptions.
5. Price switching for simple subscriptions is enabled on activation, but can be disabled via WooCommerce > Settings > Subscriptions > Switching

Requires both [Name Your Price](https://www.woocommerce.com/products/name-your-price/) version 2.9.0 and [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://www.woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) version 2.6.0 in order to function.
